### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

Working my way up from Newbie status within the Frontend Mentor projects. 
This was a junior project.
I struggled  with this project. 
My first time using grid. 
The background images are not as per the design, the 'view plans' button did not line up, the menu on small screens is not as per the design.
Still a lot to learn and implement.
